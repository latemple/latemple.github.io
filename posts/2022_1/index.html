  </p>
  <p>Lauren King is an accomplished woman, deeply committed to civic, career and family responsibilities.</p>
<p>Born in Wilmington, Delaware, Lauren moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when she was five and then moved to Long Island, New York for high school, where she graduated with honors.  She was a painting major at Carnegie-Mellon University and graduated from Moore College with a BFA in Interior Design in 1977.  She began her apprenticeship at Daroff Design, a top 100 commercial design firm in 1975, and stayed there until she was hired full time in 1977. Her work included projects such as the Chamber of Commerce building in Pennsylvania and Prudential Parsippany in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Lauren moved to Los Angeles in October 1977 where she worked as a space planner and decorator for an office design firm, as well as working for Integrated Design, a company which specialized in hotel design.  In 1982, she launched her own design firm, LD Design.  Her clients included major production offices such as RKO Pictures, Keith Barish Production Company, and Lauren Schuler Productions.</p>
<p>As her career evolved, her interests shifted to residential design where she specialized in architectural homes.  She worked on such notable Neutra homes as the Singleton House and Loring House, as well as the Smalley House, A. Quincy Jones home.  Lauren moved on to decorating all types of homes in 1990.  She continues to work primarily in residential design.  Lauren’s designs have been featured in numerous prestigious publications, such as Architectural Digest, Los Angeles Confidential, House and Garden, The Hollywood Reporter, Power of Gardens, New Traditional Architecture, Angeles Magazine, and Audio/Visual Magazine.</p>
<p>In 1994, she married a client, Richard King, of King World Productions.  After getting married, Lauren changed her design firm’s name to Lauren King, Inc.  She now spends most of her design time on various projects, including their homes in Los Angeles, Florida, and Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>Lauren has a twenty-seven-year-old son Bobby, three married stepsons and five grandchildren.  She is a very involved parent and served as a member of the Headmaster Circle at her son’s school.</p>
<p>Lauren is also involved in her community.  Her civic interests lie in architectural preservation.  She served on the Board of the Los Angeles Conservancy for many years.

For the last several years, Lauren has co-chaired all of the main fundraising events for the LA Conservancy with Diane Keaton.  She has was on the Board of MOCA where she served for over three years.</p>
<p>Her charitable activism is diverse and far reaching—much of it having to do with children.  She is a member of The Colleagues that serves The Children’s Institute.  She was involved with the Caron Foundation for which her husband served on the Board.  In 2008, Lauren co-chaired the Caron Foundation’s annual fundraising event in Palm Beach, Florida and was the West Coast Chairman for the Palm Beach Preservation Society event from 2004 through 2007.  She is a founding member and past honoree of Beit T’Shuvah.  She was a founding member and on the Board of Directors of Coach for Kids.   She also served on the Board of the Holmby Hills Homeowners’ Association of which she was President for seven years.</p>
<p>Lauren was also a founding member and on the Board of the Aspen Center for New Medicine, which became the Aspen Center for Integrative Health.  It has since closed, but it helped start Pathfinders and several other charities.  She is a past Board member of the Los Angeles Music Center’s Blue Ribbon.  Lauren is also very involved with many other charities including The Race to Erase MS and worked on LA Alive for almost twenty years.  Lauren and her husband, Richard, are dedicated to giving support to charities worldwide.</p>
<p>Lauren launched a website almost 10 years ago, TheLifeSite.com, that is dedicated to conscious transformation.</p>
